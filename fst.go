// Package fst is a high-performance, lightweight library for generating and parsing Fast Signed Tokens (FST).
// FST provides an alternative to JSON-based tokens and allows you to store any information that can be represented as []byte.
// You can use FST for the same purposes as JWT.
//
// For work with the browser and HTTP in general, use EncodedConverter!
// But if you don't need it, you can use Converter instead, as it is faster and more lightweight.
//
